## Setup guidelines
These are the setup guidelines. Please read them carefully and try to understand and follow them.

******

### Rule 1: Start with all functions disabled
From experience I know that starting with everything disabled is NOT what people tend to do or like... <br>
But if you have just installed this flow for the first time, it is likely you are used to a very simple control. You might have already figured out an operating window which gives you comfort in your home, using that. 

So, please start with that. 

Why? <br>
- You need to make sure the very basics of the dashboard are working as expected.
- You need to build up a reference feel and insights on the basic operation.
- You will likely see a lot of new things like indicaters or knobs to turn. Diving in the depth directly, is a bad idea and could get you lost.

Only after you have confidence that the dashboard is working correctly, continue with the next steps.

### Rule 2: Configure the functions in the right order
There is only **one** correct order of configuring functions. If you do not follow this order, you can expect discomfort.<br>
The basic order is `top-down`. From big imact to little impact.

1. CCC (Custom Compensation Curve)<br>
2. RTC (Room Temperature Correction)
3. SoftStart

For the details on HOW to configure these functions correctly, see `functions` section.

******

### Rule 3: Enable functions one-by-one
Do not just enable all functions after first start and assume it works. You need to configure each function and verify it is working according to your expectation.<br>
Once configured correctly, wait and look at the result for a couple of days. 

Only after you have verified the function is working correctly and as desired, continue with the next. 

******

### Rule 4: If you think a function is behaving badly, disable the function
Sometimes it appears as if a function is not working as designed. Very easily it is concluded the function is at fault. <br>
First verify it is the function that is at fault by disabling the function.

> Example:
> If you think you have too short compressor-runs and suspect the SoftStart function is at fault, disable it and see what the behaviour is without it.
