## Requirements
**What do I need to make use of this flow?**<br/>

If you have looked at the diagram in the introduction page, you could notice you require some basic things for this to work.

<ins>You require:</ins>
- A Panasonic heatpump. *(It does not work with any other brand)*
- The heishamon module (Store: https://www.tindie.com/stores/thehognl/)
- A functional MQTT broker. ([Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)/[HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/)/[EMQX](https://www.emqx.io/)/etc.)  
- A functional Node Red instance. [Node Red](https://nodered.org/)
<br>

<ins>And on the human side:</ins>
- Time and patience
- Some IT awareness and interest
<br>

These items are the most basic things you need to have.<br>
The installation process of the heishamon module, node red or an MQTT broker, are well documented in other places like youtube or various forums. Better to search for this. Anything written here runs the risk of being out of date quickly.<br>

<ins>You do not require:</ins>
- a database backend
- Home Assistant *1

_1: To clarify; Although it is possible to have Node Red installed as App inside of Home Assistant, Home Assistant itself is not required._
